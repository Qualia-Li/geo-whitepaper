## Appendix B: Glossary of Terms

### Core GEO Concepts

**Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)**  
The practice of optimizing website content and online presence to increase visibility and citation frequency within AI-generated responses from large language models and generative search engines.

**Reference Rate**  
The percentage of relevant queries for which an AI system cites your content as a source. This metric serves as the primary KPI for GEO success, analogous to click-through rate in traditional SEO.

**Citation Frequency**  
How often AI systems reference your content across multiple queries and platforms. Higher citation frequency indicates stronger authority signals and better GEO optimization.

**Multi-Source Synthesis**  
The process by which AI systems combine information from multiple sources to create comprehensive answers, creating opportunities for multiple citations within single responses.

### Technical Terms

**Large Language Model (LLM)**  
AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Examples include GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**  
An architecture that combines large language models with external information retrieval to generate responses based on current, specific data rather than only pre-training knowledge.

**Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**  
A training method where human evaluators rank AI responses to teach models which answers are most helpful, accurate, and trustworthy.

**Search Generative Experience (SGE)**  
Google's implementation of AI-powered search overviews that provide generated summaries with source citations above traditional search results.

**Schema Markup**  
Structured data vocabulary that helps search engines and AI systems understand content context, relationships, and meaning.

**Embedding Models**  
AI systems that convert text into mathematical vectors, enabling semantic similarity analysis and content retrieval based on meaning rather than keywords.

### Authority and Trust Concepts

**E-E-A-T**  
Google's framework for evaluating content quality: Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. Particularly important for GEO as AI systems use similar signals for source evaluation.

**Knowledge Graph**  
Structured representation of information that helps AI systems understand relationships between entities, concepts, and facts.

**Citation Authority**  
The credibility level assigned to a source by AI systems based on factors like domain authority, author credentials, and citation by other authoritative sources.

**Semantic Relevance**  
The degree to which content matches user intent and query meaning, rather than just keyword matching.

### Platform-Specific Terms

**ChatGPT Search**  
OpenAI's integration of real-time web information into ChatGPT responses with source citations and attribution.

**Perplexity**  
AI-powered research engine that provides answers with academic-style citations and follow-up question capabilities.

**Bing Chat**  
Microsoft's conversational AI interface powered by GPT-4 with integrated web search and citation capabilities.

**Claude (Anthropic)**  
Large language model focused on helpful, harmless, and honest responses with strong reasoning capabilities.
