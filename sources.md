# 📚 Key Research & Thought Leadership on Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

## 🧠 Academic & Technical Research (2023–2025)

1. **Aggarwal, Pranjal et al. (2024).**  
   *“GEO: Generative Engine Optimization.”* Proceedings of ACM SIGKDD 2024.  
   [🔗 Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10968)  
   Defines **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** as the first creator-centric framework to optimize website content for AI-driven search engines. Demonstrates that content adjustments (citations, quotations, statistics) can increase the likelihood of being cited by LLMs by **~40%**. Introduces visibility metrics and a benchmark dataset for GEO research.

2. **Zhao, Siyun et al. (2024).**  
   *“Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Beyond: A Comprehensive Survey on How to Make Your LLMs Use External Data More Wisely.”*  
   [🔗 Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14924)  
   A comprehensive **survey of RAG techniques**, reviewing query categorization, retrieval integration methods, and future research directions. Highlights that there is *no one-size-fits-all* approach to retrieval and stresses the importance of aligning retrieval with user intent.

3. **Zhu, Yutao et al. (2023).**  
   *“Large Language Models for Information Retrieval: A Survey.”*  
   [🔗 Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07107)  
   Reviews the convergence of **LLMs and search systems**, covering query rewriting, document retrieval, **re-ranking**, and “search agent” orchestration. Crucial for understanding the technical backbone of generative search systems.

4. **OpenAI (2023).**  
   *“GPT-4 Technical Report.”*  
   [🔗 Report Link](https://cdn.openai.com/papers/gpt-4.pdf)  
   Explains GPT-4’s **RLHF-based ranking system**, which ensures responses align with human preferences. Relevant because GEO must consider how alignment affects which content LLMs prefer to cite.
